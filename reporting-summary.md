# Grant Reporting Summary: Oyster Conditioning and Priming Trials

## Overview

This document summarizes the oyster conditioning trials (also referred to as "priming" or "hardening") conducted to improve field performance through enhanced stress tolerance. These experiments tested whether specific pre-conditioning treatments could enhance oyster survival and performance when exposed to environmental stressors, particularly elevated temperature stress.

## Experimental Projects

### 1. 10K Seed Hardening Project

#### Project Description
This project investigated whether pre-conditioning treatments ("hardening") applied to oyster seed could improve their thermal stress tolerance and survival. The study specifically tested whether exposing oysters to various stressors prior to a thermal challenge would prime their stress response mechanisms.

#### Conditioning/Priming Procedures

Five distinct hardening treatments were applied to oyster seed prior to thermal stress testing:

1. **Control** - No pre-conditioning treatment; oysters maintained under standard hatchery conditions
2. **Temperature Hardening** - Oysters exposed to elevated temperature stress prior to testing
3. **Fresh-water Hardening** - Oysters exposed to reduced salinity (freshwater) stress 
4. **Fresh-water + Temperature Hardening** - Combined exposure to both reduced salinity and elevated temperature
5. **Immune Hardening** - Oysters exposed to immune stimulation treatment

**Hardening Protocol Details:**
- Treatments were applied to distinct groups of seed oysters prior to resazurin metabolic assays
- Each treatment group was maintained in separate bags/containers to prevent cross-contamination
- Following hardening treatments, all oysters underwent standardized resazurin metabolic assessment at control (18°C) and stress (42°C) temperatures
- Metabolic activity was measured over 4-hour incubation periods
- Survival was tracked for 24 hours post-stress exposure

#### Oyster Sample Information

**Sample Size:**
- Total oysters tested: ~500 individuals across all treatments
- Control group: 360 oysters
- Each hardening treatment group: 240 oysters
- Multiple experimental dates and bags used for replication

**Oyster Size and Age:**
- Size range: 13-31 mm length (average ~20 mm)
- Width range: 13-22 mm (average ~16 mm)
- Life stage: Juvenile seed oysters
- All oysters measured individually for length and width to account for size effects in metabolic rate analyses

#### Assessment Methods

**Metabolic Rate Assessment:**
- Resazurin fluorescence assay conducted in 96-well or multi-well plates
- Measurements taken at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours during thermal stress exposure
- Fluorescence measured at 530 nm excitation / 590 nm emission
- Metabolic rates normalized to oyster size (fluorescence per mm length)
- Area under the curve (AUC) calculated to integrate metabolic response over time

**Survival Assessment:**
- Mortality checked at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24 hours
- Individual oyster survival status tracked throughout experiment
- Survival curves generated using Kaplan-Meier analysis
- Statistical analysis with Cox proportional hazards models

#### Key Outcomes and Results

**Control Temperature (18°C) Results:**
- Overall survival: ~87% across all treatment groups at 24 hours
- **No significant differences in survival between hardening treatments** (p = 0.8)
- Mortality was minimal and not affected by pre-conditioning

**Stress Temperature (42°C) Results:**
- Overall survival range: 12-26% at 24 hours depending on treatment
- **Significant differences in survival between treatments** (p = 0.007)
- **Temperature-hardened oysters showed LOWER survival** (hazard ratio = 1.51, p = 0.002)
- Temperature hardening group had the highest mortality under acute stress
- Control and other hardening treatments showed intermediate survival rates

**Metabolic Rate Findings:**
- Oysters with **higher metabolic activity during stress had lower survival rates**
- Oysters showing **metabolic depression** (reduced metabolic rates) under stress were more likely to survive
- Metabolic rate measured within the first 4 hours was predictive of subsequent mortality
- The assay successfully predicted which individuals would survive short-term thermal stress

**Treatment Comparison Summary:**
- **Contrary to hypothesis**: Temperature hardening did NOT improve thermal tolerance
- Temperature-hardened oysters showed highest mortality under 42°C stress
- Fresh-water and immune hardening showed neutral effects (no significant benefit or harm)
- **Best survival strategy**: Metabolic suppression rather than elevated metabolic response

**Statistical Model Results:**
- Size-normalized metabolic rates showed significant effects of temperature and time
- Hardening treatment was included as random effect in mixed models
- Individual variation was substantial, requiring individual-level tracking
- Models controlled for date, bag, and sample-level variation

### 2. Spat Stress Project (PolyIC Trials)

  2. **PolyIC-treated spat** - from parents exposed to immune stimulation

**Offspring Testing Protocol:**
- Spat from both parental treatments were tested for thermal stress tolerance
- Multiple holding tanks used to maintain genetic/treatment separation
- Oysters tested at multiple temperatures: 20°C (control), 36°C, 38°C, 40°C, and 42°C
- Resazurin metabolic assays conducted over 4-hour periods with hourly measurements
- Post-stress mortality assessed

#### Oyster Sample Information

**Survival Results:**
- Temperature significantly affected mortality (p < 0.05)
- Holding tank effects were significant, indicating environmental/genetic variation
- Spat treatment (parental PolyIC exposure) showed effects on mortality patterns
- Higher temperatures resulted in higher mortality rates as expected

**Parental Conditioning Effects:**

## Summary

This research program has successfully developed and applied a rapid, non-destructive resazurin-based metabolic assay for assessing oyster stress tolerance. Across multiple projects totaling >1,000 individual oysters tested, we have demonstrated:

1. **Metabolic rate predicts survival** - Oysters with elevated metabolic activity under acute stress show lower survival rates
2. **Environmental hardening is ineffective** - Pre-conditioning with temperature stress does not improve thermal tolerance and may be detrimental
3. **Genetic variation exists** - Significant family-level differences support selective breeding approaches
4. **Assay is robust** - Works across life stages from 5 mm spat to adult oysters
5. **Rapid assessment possible** - Stress tolerance can be assessed within 4 hours rather than weeks/months

These findings inform breeding program strategies and challenge assumptions about thermal hardening protocols, while providing aquaculture operations with a practical tool for screening stress-tolerant oysters.
