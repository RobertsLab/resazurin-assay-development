Please explore the Github Repo, glimpse real-time activity in from the lab here, and dive deeper with the Canonical Protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📖 New: Public Summary Available\n\n\n\nFor a general audience overview of this research, including implications for the aquaculture industry and key findings to date, see our Public Summary: Resazurin Assay for Oyster Health Assessment.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nThis protocol uses a resazurin-based assay to measure individual metabolic responses to elevated temperature stress over a 5-hour period. Resazurin is a redox-sensitive dye that changes fluorescence and color as it is reduced by cellular respiration, providing a proxy for metabolic activity. Individuals are incubated in a resazurin working solution at a high temperature (e.g., ~42°C), and metabolic activity is monitored through fluorescence measurements taken at hourly intervals. Fluorescence measurements are conducted using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm (or a 528/20 nm bandpass filter) and an emission wavelength of 590 nm (or a 590/20 nm bandpass filter) using a plate reader.\n\n\n\nResorufin is highly fluorescent (excitation ~570 nm, emission ~585 nm). The amount of resorufin produced is directly proportional to the metabolic activity of the cells.\n\n\n\n\nHighlights to date\n• Metabolic rate is a reliable predictor of stress resilience — oysters that suppress metabolic activity under stress tend to survive better than those with heightened activity.\n• Rapid assessment is possible — survival potential can be predicted within hours using the resazurin assay, eliminating the need for long-term trials.\n• Genetic background drives metabolic performance — consistent family-level and line-level differences demonstrate that stress-tolerant metabolic traits are heritable.\n• Assay is scalable across life stages and conditions — works effectively from tiny spat (~7 mm) to adult oysters, across temperature and salinity stressors.\n• Parental and ploidy effects matter — offspring inherit stress resistance from conditioned parents, and diploid vs triploid oysters show distinct metabolic signatures.\n• Multiple assay methods align — both fluorescence and absorbance measurements give consistent outcomes, strengthening confidence in results.\n\n\nVideo Demo\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing solutions\nTo prepare the resazurin assay solutions, first make a stock by combining resazurin salt with water and a small amount of DMSO. Store this stock in a dark refrigerator or freezer. The working solution consists primarily of seawater (about 98.5%), with small proportions of resazurin stock (0.2%), DMSO (0.1%), and an antibiotic/antifungal solution (1%). Adjust the total volume based on the number and size of organisms being tested, ensuring animals are fully submerged. Trials are typically scaled for small (≤7 mm), medium (15–40 mm), or large (&gt;40 mm) seed using appropriately sized containers.\n\nDetailed example\n\nStock resazurin solution \n\nTo make the resazurin stock solution (10 mL) mix the following. We will use this solution for multiple trials. \n\n0.5 g resazurin salt\n10 mL DI water\n10 µL DMSO\n\nStore in a dark fridge or freezer. \n\nWorking resazurin solution\n\nFirst, determine the volume of resazurin required depending on the size of your organism and the container size. Here are some examples that we have used before. We recommend performing preliminary trials to ensure that a change in resazurin fluorescence can be detected over the time scale desired. This protocol was developed to detect a change in resazurin fluorescence within 5 hours in small seed (&lt;7mm) and larger seed (10-30mm). \n\nSmall seed (&lt;7mm length): trials conducted in 96 well plates (300uL volume in each well)\nMedium seed (15-40 mm length): trials conducted in small plastic cups (20 mL volume) or 12, 24, or 48-well plates\nLarge seed/adults (&gt;40 mm length): trials can be conducted in tripour cups, beakers, or plastic cups. Scale volume appropriately. The animals should be fully submerged. \n\nTo prepare the working solution of resazurin, prepare the following. \n\nDesired working volume x 0.98666 = ___ mL filtered seawater (DI water with Instant Ocean adjusted to 23-25 ppt or filtered (&lt;1um) seawater) \nDesired working volume x 0.00222 = ___ mL resazurin stock solution as made above in step 1 \nDesired working volume x 0.001 = ___ mL DMSO\nDesired working volume x 0.01 = ___ mL antibiotic solution 100x Penn/Strep & 100x Fungizone - this should be kept frozen in a dark freezer and thawed before use (thaw in the dark or cover with aluminum foil)\n\nHere is an example recipe for 150 mL of working stock. To run a single 96 well plate, approximately 35 mL will be required (allowing for extra for re-do’s or errors). For example, if we are running 4 total plates, we will need to prepare 4 x 35 mL = 150 mL of working solution. Increase if more is required. \n\n148 mL seawater (DI water with Instant Ocean adjusted to 23-25 ppt or filtered (&lt;1um) seawater) \n333 µL resazurin stock solution as made above in step 1 \n150 µL DMSO\n1.5 mL antibiotic solution 100x Penn/Strep & 100x Fungizone \n\n\n\n\nInteractive Recipe Calculator\nUse this calculator to automatically determine the required amounts of each ingredient based on your experimental setup:\n\nviewof plateType = Inputs.select(\n  [\n    \"96-well plate (35 mL per plate)\",\n    \"48-well plate (25 mL per plate)\", \n    \"24-well plate (15 mL per plate)\",\n    \"12-well plate (10 mL per plate)\",\n    \"Custom volume\"\n  ],\n  {\n    label: \"Plate type:\",\n    value: \"96-well plate (35 mL per plate)\"\n  }\n)\n\nviewof numPlates = Inputs.range([1, 20], {\n  label: \"Number of plates:\",\n  value: 1,\n  step: 1\n})\n\nviewof customVolume = Inputs.range([1, 500], {\n  label: \"Custom total volume (mL):\",\n  value: 35,\n  step: 1,\n  disabled: plateType !== \"Custom volume\"\n})\n\nviewof extraPercent = Inputs.range([0, 50], {\n  label: \"Extra volume for safety (%):\",\n  value: 10,\n  step: 5\n})\n\n// Calculations\nplateVolumes = new Map([\n  [\"96-well plate (35 mL per plate)\", 35],\n  [\"48-well plate (25 mL per plate)\", 25],\n  [\"24-well plate (15 mL per plate)\", 15], \n  [\"12-well plate (10 mL per plate)\", 10],\n  [\"Custom volume\", customVolume]\n])\n\nbaseVolume = plateVolumes.get(plateType) * numPlates\ntotalVolume = baseVolume * (1 + extraPercent / 100)\n\nseawaterVolume = totalVolume * 0.98666\nresazurinVolume = totalVolume * 0.00222\ndmsoVolume = totalVolume * 0.001\nantibioticVolume = totalVolume * 0.01\n\n// Helper function to format volumes appropriately\nfunction formatVolume(volume) {\n  if (volume &gt;= 1) {\n    return volume.toFixed(2) + \" mL\";\n  } else {\n    return (volume * 1000).toFixed(0) + \" µL\";\n  }\n}\n\n// Display results\nhtml`\n&lt;div style=\"background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;\"&gt;\n  &lt;h3 style=\"color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0;\"&gt;📋 Recipe for ${totalVolume.toFixed(1)} mL Working Solution&lt;/h3&gt;\n  \n  &lt;div style=\"background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;\"&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimental setup:&lt;/strong&gt; ${numPlates} × ${plateType.split(' (')[0]} \n    ${plateType !== \"Custom volume\" ? `(${baseVolume.toFixed(1)} mL base volume)` : ''}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety margin:&lt;/strong&gt; +${extraPercent}% extra volume&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;div style=\"background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\"&gt;\n    &lt;h4 style=\"color: #27ae60; margin-top: 0;\"&gt;🧪 Required Ingredients:&lt;/h4&gt;\n    &lt;ul style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8;\"&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;${formatVolume(seawaterVolume)}&lt;/strong&gt; filtered seawater (DI water with Instant Ocean adjusted to 23-25 ppt or filtered &lt;1μm seawater)&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;${formatVolume(resazurinVolume)}&lt;/strong&gt; resazurin stock solution (from step 1 above)&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;${formatVolume(dmsoVolume)}&lt;/strong&gt; DMSO&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;${formatVolume(antibioticVolume)}&lt;/strong&gt; antibiotic solution (100x Penn/Strep & 100x Fungizone)&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  \n  &lt;div style=\"background: #fff3cd; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin-top: 15px; font-size: 14px;\"&gt;\n    &lt;strong&gt;💡 Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Remember to thaw the antibiotic solution in the dark before use, and store the resazurin stock solution in a dark fridge or freezer.\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Slidedecks\n\n📄 View VIMS 2025 talk (PDF)"
