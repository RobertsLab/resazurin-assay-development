Please explore the Github Repo, glimpse real-time activity in from the lab here, and dive deeper with the Canonical Protocol.\n\n\nSummary\nThis protocol uses a resazurin-based assay to measure individual metabolic responses to elevated temperature stress over a 5-hour period. Resazurin is a redox-sensitive dye that changes fluorescence and color as it is reduced by cellular respiration, providing a proxy for metabolic activity. Individuals are incubated in a resazurin working solution at a high temperature (e.g., ~42°C), and metabolic activity is monitored through fluorescence measurements taken at hourly intervals. Fluorescence measurements are conducted using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm (or a 528/20 nm bandpass filter) and an emission wavelength of 590 nm (or a 590/20 nm bandpass filter) using a plate reader.\n\n\nHighlights to date\n\nResazurin fluorescence provides a reliable indicator of oyster metabolic activity from small seed to adult oysters.\nThermal performance assays reveal metabolic optima and tipping points where metabolic stimulation shifts to depression under temperature stress.\nResazurin fluorescence detects genetic differences in metabolic rates between oyster family groups.\nUnder acute stress, increased metabolism of seed at high temperature predicts short-term mortality. In contrast, metabolic depression is associated with higher survival.\nResazurin fluorescence assays provide an exciting potential tool to survey oyster performance.\n\n\n\nVideo Demo\n\n\n\nPreparing solutions\nTo prepare the resazurin assay solutions, first make a stock by combining resazurin salt with water and a small amount of DMSO. Store this stock in a dark refrigerator or freezer. The working solution consists primarily of seawater (about 98.5%), with small proportions of resazurin stock (0.2%), DMSO (0.1%), and an antibiotic/antifungal solution (1%). Adjust the total volume based on the number and size of organisms being tested, ensuring animals are fully submerged. Trials are typically scaled for small (≤7 mm), medium (15–40 mm), or large (&gt;40 mm) seed using appropriately sized containers.\n\nDetailed example\n\nStock resazurin solution \n\nTo make the resazurin stock solution (10 mL) mix the following. We will use this solution for multiple trials. \n\n0.5 g resazurin salt\n10 mL DI water\n10 µL DMSO\n\nStore in a dark fridge or freezer. \n\nWorking resazurin solution\n\nFirst, determine the volume of resazurin required depending on the size of your organism and the container size. Here are some examples that we have used before. We recommend performing preliminary trials to ensure that a change in resazurin fluorescence can be detected over the time scale desired. This protocol was developed to detect a change in resazurin fluorescence within 5 hours in small seed (&lt;7mm) and larger seed (10-30mm). \n\nSmall seed (&lt;7mm length): trials conducted in 96 well plates (300uL volume in each well)\nMedium seed (15-40 mm length): trials conducted in small plastic cups (20 mL volume)\nLarge seed/adults (&gt;40 mm length): trials can be conducted in tripour cups, beakers, or plastic cups. Scale volume appropriately. The animals should be fully submerged. \n\nTo prepare the working solution of resazurin, prepare the following. \nThis recipe is to make 150 mL of working stock. To run a single 96 well plate, approximately 35 mL will be required (allowing for extra for re-do’s or errors). For example, if we are running 4 total plates, we will need to prepare 4 x 35 mL = 150 mL of working solution. Increase if more is required. \n\n148 mL seawater (DI water with Instant Ocean adjusted to 23-25 ppt or filtered (&lt;1um) seawater) \n333 µL resazurin stock solution as made above in step 1 \n150 µL DMSO\n1.5 mL antibiotic solution 100x Penn/Strep & 100x Fungizone - this should be kept frozen in a dark freezer and thawed before use (thaw in the dark or cover with aluminum foil)\n\n\n\n\nRecent Slidedecks\n\n📄 View VIMS 2025 talk (PDF)\n\n\nPodcast ?\nWhile not solely focused on resazurin… a majority of content covers what we are doing in this space."
