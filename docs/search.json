    "text": "Landing page for quick info on where we are with implementing easy resazurin metabolism assays for oysters. Please explore the Github Repo, glimpse real-time activity in from the lab here, and dive deeper with the Canonical Protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📖 New: Public Summary Available\n\n\n\nFor a general audience overview of this research, including implications for the aquaculture industry and key findings to date, see our Public Summary: Resazurin Assay for Oyster Health Assessment.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nThis protocol uses a resazurin-based assay to measure individual metabolic responses to elevated temperature stress over a 4-5-hour period. Resazurin is a redox-sensitive dye that fluoresces as it is reduced by cellular respiration, providing a proxy for metabolic activity. Individuals are incubated in a resazurin working solution at a high temperature (e.g., ~42°C), and metabolic activity is monitored through fluorescence measurements taken at hourly intervals. Fluorescence measurements are conducted using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm (e.g., a 528/20 nm bandpass filter) and an emission wavelength of 590 nm (e.g., a 590/20 nm bandpass filter) using a fluorescence plate reader.\n\n\n\nResorufin is highly fluorescent (excitation ~570 nm, emission ~585 nm). The amount of resorufin produced is directly proportional to the metabolic activity of the cells.\n\n\n\n\nHighlights to date\n• Metabolic rate is a reliable predictor of short-term stress resilience — oysters that suppress metabolic activity under stress tend to survive better than those with heightened activity in laboratory tests.\n• Rapid assessment is possible — metabolism can be measured rapidly at at high replication, within hours using the resazurin assay, eliminating the need for long-term trials or multiple days of traditional respiration measurements.\n• Genetic background drives metabolic performance — consistent family-level and line-level differences demonstrate that stress-tolerant metabolic traits are heritable.\n• Assay is scalable across life stages and conditions — works effectively from tiny spat (~7 mm) to adult oysters, across temperature and salinity stressors.\n• Parental and ploidy effects matter — offspring stress resistance is affected by parental histry, and diploid vs triploid oysters show distinct metabolic signatures.\n• High sensitivity measurements — fluorescence measurements provide highly sensitive measurements of oyster metabolism.\n\n\nVideo Demo\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing solutions\nTo prepare the resazurin assay solutions, first make a stock by combining resazurin salt with water and a small amount of DMSO. Store this stock in a dark refrigerator or freezer. The working solution consists primarily of seawater (about 98.5%), with small proportions of resazurin stock (0.2%), DMSO (0.1%), and an antibiotic/antifungal solution (1%). Adjust the total volume based on the number and size of organisms being tested, ensuring animals are fully submerged. Trials are typically scaled for small (≤7 mm), medium (15–40 mm), or large (&gt;40 mm) seed using appropriately sized containers. See our widget below to calculate the solutions required! See our Canonical Protocol for further details.\n\nSolutions required\n\nStock resazurin solution \n\nTo make the resazurin stock solution (10 mL) mix the following. We will use this solution for multiple trials. \n\n0.5 g resazurin salt\n10 mL DI water\n10 µL DMSO\n\nStore in a dark fridge or freezer. \n\nWorking resazurin solution\n\nFirst, determine the volume of resazurin required depending on the size of your organism and the container size. Here are some examples that we have used before. We recommend performing preliminary trials to ensure that a change in resazurin fluorescence can be detected over the time scale desired. This protocol was developed to detect a change in resazurin fluorescence within 5 hours in small seed (&lt;7mm) and larger seed (10-30mm). \n\nSmall seed (&lt;7mm length): trials conducted in 96 well plates (300uL volume in each well)\nMedium seed (15-40 mm length): trials conducted in small plastic cups (20 mL volume) or 12, 24, or 48-well plates\nLarge seed/adults (&gt;40 mm length): trials can be conducted in tripour cups, beakers, or plastic cups. Scale volume appropriately. The animals should be fully submerged. \n\nUse the calculator below to calculate the formula for your working solution.\nThe working solution requires the following: \n\nFiltered seawater (DI water with Instant Ocean adjusted to 23-25 ppt or filtered (&lt;1um) seawater) \nResazurin stock solution as made above in step 1 \nDMSO\nAntibiotic solution 100x Penn/Strep & 100x Fungizone - this should be kept frozen in a dark freezer and thawed before use (thaw in the dark or cover with aluminum foil)\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Recipe Calculator\nUse this calculator to automatically determine the required amounts of each ingredient based on your experimental setup.\n\nviewof plateType = Inputs.select(\n  [\n    \"96-well plate (35 mL per plate)\",\n    \"48-well plate (25 mL per plate)\", \n    \"24-well plate (15 mL per plate)\",\n    \"12-well plate (10 mL per plate)\",\n    \"Custom volume\"\n  ],\n  {\n    label: \"Plate type:\",\n    value: \"96-well plate (35 mL per plate)\"\n  }\n)\n\nviewof numPlates = Inputs.range([1, 80], {\n  label: \"Number of plates:\",\n  value: 1,\n  step: 1\n})\n\nviewof customVolume = Inputs.range([1, 2000], {\n  label: \"Custom total volume (mL):\",\n  value: 35,\n  step: 1,\n  disabled: plateType !== \"Custom volume\"\n})\n\nviewof extraPercent = Inputs.range([0, 20], {\n  label: \"Extra volume for safety (%):\",\n  value: 10,\n  step: 5\n})\n\n// Calculations\nplateVolumes = new Map([\n  [\"96-well plate (35 mL per plate)\", 35],\n  [\"48-well plate (25 mL per plate)\", 25],\n  [\"24-well plate (15 mL per plate)\", 15], \n  [\"12-well plate (10 mL per plate)\", 10],\n  [\"Custom volume\", customVolume]\n])\n\nbaseVolume = plateVolumes.get(plateType) * numPlates\ntotalVolume = baseVolume * (1 + extraPercent / 100)\n\nseawaterVolume = totalVolume * 0.98666\nresazurinVolume = totalVolume * 0.00222\ndmsoVolume = totalVolume * 0.001\nantibioticVolume = totalVolume * 0.01\n\n// Helper function to format volumes appropriately\nfunction formatVolume(volume) {\n  if (volume &gt;= 1) {\n    return volume.toFixed(2) + \" mL\";\n  } else {\n    return (volume * 1000).toFixed(0) + \" µL\";\n  }\n}\n\n// Display results\nhtml`\n&lt;div style=\"background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;\"&gt;\n  &lt;h3 style=\"color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0;\"&gt;📋 Recipe for ${totalVolume.toFixed(1)} mL Working Solution&lt;/h3&gt;\n  \n  &lt;div style=\"background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;\"&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimental setup:&lt;/strong&gt; ${numPlates} × ${plateType.split(' (')[0]} \n    ${plateType !== \"Custom volume\" ? `(${baseVolume.toFixed(1)} mL base volume)` : ''}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety margin:&lt;/strong&gt; +${extraPercent}% extra volume&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;div style=\"background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\"&gt;\n    &lt;h4 style=\"color: #27ae60; margin-top: 0;\"&gt;🧪 Required Ingredients:&lt;/h4&gt;\n    &lt;ul style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8;\"&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;${formatVolume(seawaterVolume)}&lt;/strong&gt; filtered seawater (DI water with Instant Ocean adjusted to 23-25 ppt or filtered &lt;1μm seawater)&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;${formatVolume(resazurinVolume)}&lt;/strong&gt; resazurin stock solution (from step 1 above)&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;${formatVolume(dmsoVolume)}&lt;/strong&gt; DMSO&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;${formatVolume(antibioticVolume)}&lt;/strong&gt; antibiotic solution (100x Penn/Strep & 100x Fungizone)&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  \n  &lt;div style=\"background: #fff3cd; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin-top: 15px; font-size: 14px;\"&gt;\n    &lt;strong&gt;💡 Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Remember to thaw the antibiotic solution in the dark before use, and store the resazurin stock solution in a dark fridge or freezer.\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of resazurin plates\n\n\n\nOyster seed loaded into a 48-well plate for resazurin testing.\n\n\n\n\n\nOyster seed with resazurin solution at the start of a resazurin trial.
