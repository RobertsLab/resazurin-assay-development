# Summary

This protocol uses a resazurin-based assay to measure individual
metabolic responses to elevated temperature stress over a 4-5-hour
period. Resazurin is a redox-sensitive dye that fluoresces as it is
reduced by cellular respiration, providing a proxy for metabolic
activity. Individuals are incubated in a resazurin working solution at a
high temperature (e.g., \~42Â°C), and metabolic activity is monitored
through fluorescence measurements taken at hourly intervals.
Fluorescence measurements are conducted using an excitation wavelength
of 530 nm (e.g., a 528/20 nm bandpass filter) and an emission wavelength
of 590 nm (e.g., a 590/20 nm bandpass filter) using a fluorescence plate
reader.

![Resorufin is highly fluorescent (excitation \~570 nm, emission \~585
nm). The amount of resorufin produced is directly proportional to the
metabolic activity of the
cells.](http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/Monosnap_httpsgannet.fish.washington.eduseashellsnaps2025-VIMS-Roberts.pdf_2025-08-27_16-08-26.png){width="75%"}

# Highlights to date

â€¢ **Metabolic rate is a reliable predictor of short-term stress
resilience** â€” oysters that suppress metabolic activity under stress
tend to survive better than those with heightened activity in laboratory
tests.\
â€¢ **Rapid assessment is possible** â€” metabolism can be measured rapidly
at at high replication, within hours using the resazurin assay,
eliminating the need for long-term trials or multiple days of
traditional respiration measurements.\
â€¢ **Genetic background drives metabolic performance** â€” consistent
family-level and line-level differences demonstrate that stress-tolerant
metabolic traits are heritable.\
â€¢ **Assay is scalable across life stages and conditions** â€” works
effectively from tiny spat (\~7 mm) to adult oysters, across temperature
and salinity stressors.\
â€¢ **Parental and ploidy effects matter** â€” offspring stress resistance
is affected by parental histry, and diploid vs triploid oysters show
distinct metabolic signatures.\
â€¢ **High sensitivity measurements** â€” fluorescence measurements provide
highly sensitive measurements of oyster metabolism.

# Preparing solutions

To prepare the resazurin assay solutions, first make a stock by
combining resazurin salt with water and a small amount of DMSO. Store
this stock in a dark refrigerator or freezer. The working solution
consists primarily of seawater (about 98.5%), with small proportions of
resazurin stock (0.2%), DMSO (0.1%), and an antibiotic/antifungal
solution (1%). Adjust the total volume based on the number and size of
organisms being tested, ensuring animals are fully submerged. Trials are
typically scaled for small (â‰¤7â€¯mm), medium (15â€“40â€¯mm), or large
(\>40â€¯mm) seed using appropriately sized containers. See our widget
below to calculate the solutions required! See our [Canonical
Protocol](https://robertslab.github.io/resources/protocols/resazurin-assay/)
for further details.

### Solutions required

1.  Stock resazurin solutionÂ 

To make the resazurin stock solution (10 mL) mix the following. We will
use this solution for multiple trials.Â 

-   [0.5 g resazurin
    salt](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/R12204)

-   10 mL DI water

-   10 ÂµL DMSO

Store in a dark fridge or freezer.Â 

2.  Working resazurin solution

First, determine the volume of resazurin required depending on the size
of your organism and the container size. Here are some examples that we
have used before. We recommend performing preliminary trials to ensure
that a change in resazurin fluorescence can be detected over the time
scale desired. This protocol was developed to detect a change in
resazurin fluorescence within 5 hours in small seed (\<7mm) and larger
seed (10-30mm).Â 

-   Small seed (\<7mm length): trials conducted in 96 well plates (300uL
    volume in each well)

-   Medium seed (15-40 mm length): trials conducted in small plastic
    cups (20 mL volume) or 12, 24, or 48-well plates

-   Large seed/adults (\>40 mm length): trials can be conducted in
    tripour cups, beakers, or plastic cups. Scale volume appropriately.
    The animals should be fully submerged.Â 

Use the calculator below to calculate the formula for your working
solution.

The working solution requires the following:Â 

-   Filtered seawater (DI water with Instant Ocean adjusted to 23-25 ppt
    or filtered (\<1um) seawater)Â 

-   Resazurin stock solution as made above in step 1Â 

-   DMSO

-   Antibiotic solutionÂ [100x Penn/Strep & 100x
    Fungizone](https://us.vwr.com/store/product/4648458/null)Â - this
    should be kept frozen in a dark freezer and thawed before use (thaw
    in the dark or cover with aluminum foil)
