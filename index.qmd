Landing page for quick info on where we are with **implementing easy
resazurin metabolism assays** for oysters. Please
explore the [Github
Repo](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resazurin-assay-development), 
glimpse real-time activity in from the lab
[here](https://genefish.wordpress.com/?s=resazurin), and dive deeper with the [Canonical Protocol](https://robertslab.github.io/resources/protocols/resazurin-assay/).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Summary

This protocol uses a resazurin-based assay to measure individual
metabolic responses to elevated temperature stress over a 5-hour period.
Resazurin is a redox-sensitive dye that changes fluorescence and color
as it is reduced by cellular respiration, providing a proxy for
metabolic activity. Individuals are incubated in a resazurin working
solution at a high temperature (e.g., \~42Â°C), and metabolic activity is
monitored through fluorescence measurements taken at
hourly intervals. Fluorescence measurements are conducted using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm (or a 528/20 nm bandpass filter) and an emission wavelength of 590 nm (or a 590/20 nm bandpass filter) using a plate reader.

# Highlights to date

- Resazurin fluorescence provides a reliable indicator of oyster metabolic activity from small seed to adult oysters. 
- Thermal performance assays reveal metabolic optima and tipping points where metabolic stimulation shifts to depression under temperature stress. 
- Resazurin fluorescence detects genetic differences in metabolic rates between oyster family groups. 
- Under acute stress, increased metabolism of seed at high temperature predicts short-term mortality. In contrast, metabolic depression is associated with higher survival. 
- Resazurin fluorescence assays provide an exciting potential tool to survey oyster performance.

# Preparing solutions

To prepare the resazurin assay solutions, first make a stock by combining resazurin salt with water and a small amount of DMSO. Store this stock in a dark refrigerator or freezer. The working solution consists primarily of seawater (about 98.5%), with small proportions of resazurin stock (0.2%), DMSO (0.1%), and an antibiotic/antifungal solution (1%). Adjust the total volume based on the number and size of organisms being tested, ensuring animals are fully submerged. Trials are typically scaled for small (â‰¤7â€¯mm), medium (15â€“40â€¯mm), or large (>40â€¯mm) seed using appropriately sized containers.

### Detailed example 

1.  Stock resazurin solutionÂ 

To make the resazurin stock solution (10 mL) mix the following. We will
use this solution for multiple trials.Â 

-   [0.5 g resazurin
    salt](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/R12204)

-   10 mL DI water

-   10 ÂµL DMSO

Store in a dark fridge or freezer.Â 

2.  Working resazurin solution

First, determine the volume of resazurin required depending on the size
of your organism and the container size. Here are some examples that we
have used before. We recommend performing preliminary trials to ensure
that a change in resazurin fluorescence can be detected over the time
scale desired. This protocol was developed to detect a change in
resazurin fluorescence within 5 hours in small seed (\<7mm) and larger
seed (10-30mm).Â 

-   Small seed (\<7mm length): trials conducted in 96 well plates (300uL
    volume in each well)

-   Medium seed (15-40 mm length): trials conducted in small plastic
    cups (20 mL volume)

-   Large seed/adults (\>40 mm length): trials can be conducted in
    tripour cups, beakers, or plastic cups. Scale volume appropriately.
    The animals should be fully submerged.Â 

To prepare the working solution of resazurin, prepare the following.Â 

This recipe is to make 150 mL of working stock. To run a single 96 well
plate, approximately 35 mL will be required (allowing for extra for
re-do's or errors). For example, if we are running 4 total plates, we
will need to prepare 4 x 35 mL = 150 mL of working solution. Increase if
more is required.Â 

-   148 mL seawater (DI water with Instant Ocean adjusted to 23-25 ppt
    or filtered (\<1um) seawater)Â 

-   333 ÂµL resazurin stock solution as made above in step 1Â 

-   150 ÂµL DMSO

-   1.5 mL antibiotic solutionÂ [100x Penn/Strep & 100x
    Fungizone](https://us.vwr.com/store/product/4648458/null)Â - this
    should be kept frozen in a dark freezer and thawed before use (thaw
    in the dark or cover with aluminum foil)
