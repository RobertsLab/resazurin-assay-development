# resazurin-assay-development

This repository includes resazurin assay development with data from three sets of experiments. For each experiment, data required for resazurin analyses is included in this repository. See links to each project provided below to see additional datasets.    

1. *10K Seed Project*: In this project, we exposed oyster seed to several environmental conditions and tested subsequent response to thermal stress using the resazurin assay. Here, we tested the effects of acute temperature on resazurin measurements and evaluated the relationship between resazurin measurements and mortality. See the full project repository [on GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/10K-seed-Cgigas). 

2. *Spat Stress Project*: In this project, we exposed spat from two parental immune challenge histories to thermal stress and measured response using the resazurin assay. Here, we tested the effects of a range of temperatures on resazurin measurements in an early life stage. See the full project repository [on GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/polyIC-larvae).  

3. *USDA Families Project*: In this project, we exposed oysters from 5 USDA POGS families to stress and examined resazurin response. Here, we measured family level genetic variation on resazurin measurements and we also tested consistency between absorbance and fluorescence measurement modes.
